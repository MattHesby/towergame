	<h3 id="instbut"> Instructions </h3>
	<p> For round 1, you will be given 2 Warriors to place.  Each consecutive round you will be given only 1 warrior.  Upgrading a warrior makes them go from 2 hits to kill, to 1 hit to kill.  Warriors can move as far as they can shoot (within the range of the circle).  You must survive long enough that one of the spawners(yellow circle) reaches the side of the play area.  You must stop the enemies from getting to the bottom of the play area.</p> <br>
<p>Green Warriors have not recieved an upgrade yet.</p></div>
